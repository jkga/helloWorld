# HelloWorld
This mobile application aims to monitor physical human interaction by recording digitally all possible close human contacts
and visited places with a very least minimum action and effort. This also aims to ensure that recording and tracing
of all contacts wil be faster and more reliable than memory and written notes.

### How HelloWorld App works
This application generates a unique  **Virtual Identification Document (VID)** `QR code` per registered account
that could be easily retrieve and recorded by another `HelloWorld App` thru  built-in **VID** scanner. This ensures
that interaction is properly recorded in which the risk of exposure is reduced by imposing touchless and seamless retrieval of `public identification` that could be used during close contact tracing.

#### What is VID ?
- **VID** stands for `Virtual Identification Document` which is a **public** sharable information used for recording
